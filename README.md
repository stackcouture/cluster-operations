## Overview

**Cluster Operations** contains the CI/CD workflows responsible for building, securing, versioning, and delivering operational automation workloads to a GitOps-managed Kubernetes platform.

Rather than deploying directly to Kubernetes, this repository follows GitOps principles:

- Build container images
- Publish images to Google Artifact Registry
- Update Kubernetes manifests in the GitOps repository
- Let ArgoCD reconcile the desired state into Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)

This approach provides a fully auditable, declarative, and automated deployment workflow.

## Repository Responsibilities

This repository automates:

- Docker image builds
- Google Cloud authentication using Workload Identity Federation (OIDC)
- Container image publishing
- GitOps manifest updates
- Kustomize image version management
- Automated deployment promotion
- CI/CD pipeline execution using GitHub Actions

---
## Current Automation

### Daily Platform Report

The repository currently builds and delivers the **Daily Platform Report** automation.

The application is deployed as a Kubernetes **CronJob** through GitOps and automatically generates a daily operational report that is delivered to Slack.

The report includes platform health information such as:

- Cluster status
- Node health
- Pod health
- Deployment status
- Resource utilization
- Platform summary

## CI/CD Workflow

The GitHub Actions pipeline performs the following steps:

```
Source Code
      │
      ▼
Checkout Repository
      │
      ▼
Authenticate to Google Cloud
      │
      ▼
Configure Docker
      │
      ▼
Build Docker Image
      │
      ▼
Push Image to Artifact Registry
      │
      ▼
Checkout GitOps Repository
      │
      ▼
Update Kustomize Image Tag
      │
      ▼
Commit Updated Manifest
      │
      ▼
Push Changes
      │
      ▼
ArgoCD Synchronization
      │
      ▼
Deploy Updated CronJob
```

---
## Deployment Workflow

Unlike traditional CI/CD pipelines, this repository does **not** deploy directly to Kubernetes.

Deployment is fully GitOps-driven.

```
GitHub Actions
        │
        ▼
Artifact Registry
        │
        ▼
GitOps Repository
        │
        ▼
ArgoCD
        │
        ▼
Google Kubernetes Engine
        │
        ▼
CronJob Deployment
```

---
## Runtime Execution

Once deployed, Kubernetes executes the automation according to the CronJob schedule.

```
Cron Schedule
      │
      ▼
Kubernetes CronJob
      │
      ▼
Run Python Application
      │
      ▼
Collect Platform Metrics
      │
      ▼
Generate Daily Report
      │
      ▼
Send Slack Notification
```

---
## Secure Authentication

The CI pipeline authenticates to Google Cloud using **Workload Identity Federation (OIDC)**.

No service account keys are stored in GitHub.

Authentication flow:

```
GitHub Actions
        │
        ▼
OIDC Token
        │
        ▼
Workload Identity Pool
        │
        ▼
Google Service Account
        │
        ▼
Artifact Registry
```
